# Reversi-Othello Bot

**Bot that plays the classic game of Othello (also called Reversi)**

### Setup

    g++ obot.cc
    # Run the generated executable file ./a.out

### Instructions
Check the [**rules**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Rules) of the game on the wikipedia page.

1. User plays as the '**?**' player and the program plays as '**O**'.
2. Bot is smart in detecting a invalid move and prompts user to enter move again.
3. Bot is not smart enough to detect stray keyboard alphabet keypress :(
4. Keep terminal wide enough for the board ;)

Enjoy!
